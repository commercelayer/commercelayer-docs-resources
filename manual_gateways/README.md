# Manual gateways

Configuring a manual payment gateway for a market lets you safely process payments through wire transfer, cash, and other kinds of manual payment options.

To create a manual gateway you just need to choose a meaningful name that helps you identify it within your organization. Remember to flag the `require_capture` checkbox if you want to start fulfilling your orders only if the manual payment is captured.
