# Inventory return locations

Inventory return locations build a hierarchy of [stock locations](../stock\_locations/) within an [inventory model](../inventory\_models/), determining the available options for [returns](../returns/). In case an SKU is available in more stock locations, it gets returned to those with the highest priority.
