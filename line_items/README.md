# Line items

Create a line item if you want to add an SKU to an order. Other types of line items are automatically created to add a shipping cost to the order or to apply a discount. The sum of all line item amounts makes the order's total, split into subtotal, taxes, and discount. The order object includes all the data you need. You never need to make any calculations on your application.
