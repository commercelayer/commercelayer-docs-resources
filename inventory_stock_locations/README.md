# Inventory stock locations

Inventory stock locations build a hierarchy of [stock locations](../stock\_locations/) within an [inventory model](../inventory\_models/), determining the availability of SKUs that are being purchased. In case an SKU is available in more stock locations, it gets shipped from those with the highest priority.
