# Gift card recipients

When purchasing a gift card, you might want to send it to a recipient, either via email or physically — e.g. by printing the gift card and shipping it to a friend. To do that, you can create a gift card recipient and associate it with the purchased gift card. When the gift card is redeemed, you can then associate the gift card recipient with the customer that placed the order, so that the gift card is linked to their personal information.
