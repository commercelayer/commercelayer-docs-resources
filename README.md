# Introduction

Commerce Layer is a flexible commerce API that features **400+ endpoints**. This is the official reference where you can explore the complete list of our core resources, in detail.

## How it works

For each single resource you can find:

* The **resource** object and its fields, attributes, and relationships.
* The allowed **CRUD** operations you can perform on the related endpoint with basic examples of the request/response format.
