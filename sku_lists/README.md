# SKU lists

SKU lists are used to group more SKUs, either automatically (i.e. through a REGEX) or manually (i.e. by creating and sorting more SKU list items).

{% hint style="info" %}
SKU lists cannot contain [bundles](../bundles/). If a bundle is associated with an SKU list, they are considered matching resources, which is meaningful for the scope of specific [promotions](../free\_gift\_promotions/) and [promotion rules](../promotion\_rules/) application.
{% endhint %}
