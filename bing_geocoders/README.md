# Bing geocoders

[Geocoders](../geocoders/) lets you convert an address in text form into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude). A geocoder can be optionally associated with a market. By connecting a geocoder to a market, all the shipping and billing addresses belonging to that market orders will be geocoded.

To create a **Bing** geocoder choose a meaningful name that helps you identify it within your organization and add your [Bing Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/rest-services/locations/) API key.

Commerce Layer also supports [Google](../google\_geocoders/) geocoder integration.
