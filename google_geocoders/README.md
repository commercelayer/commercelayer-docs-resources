# Google geocoders

[Geocoders](../geocoders/) lets you convert an address in text form into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude). A geocoder can be optionally associated with a market. By connecting a geocoder to a market, all the shipping and billing addresses belonging to that market orders will be geocoded.

To create a **Google** geocoder choose a meaningful name that helps you identify it within your organization and add your [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) API key.

Commerce Layer also supports [Bing](../bing\_geocoders/) geocoder integration.
