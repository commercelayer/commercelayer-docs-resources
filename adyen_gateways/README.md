# Adyen gateways

Configuring an Adyen payment gateway for a market lets you safely process payments through [Adyen](https://docs.adyen.com). The Adyen gateway is compliant with the PSD2 European regulation so that you can implement a payment flow that supports SCA and 3DS2 by using the Adyen's official JS SDK and libraries.

To create an Adyen gateway choose a meaningful name that helps you identify it within your organization and gather all the credentials requested (like [merchant account](https://docs.adyen.com/account/manage-account-structure), [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials), etc. â€” contact [Adyen's support](https://www.adyen.help/hc/en-us) if you are not sure about the requested data).
