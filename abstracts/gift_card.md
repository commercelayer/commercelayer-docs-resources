A gift card is a special type of payment instrument that can be either purchased or used to pay for an order — in total or in part — depending on its outstanding balance. All gift cards must be activated before being used. Rechargeable gift cards can be reloaded at any time. Single-use gift cards become redeemed after the first usage, whatever the balance is used. Associate a gift card to a market if you want to restrict its availability to that specific market.
