An order can be configured to ship from a single stock location (i.e. primary). In this scenario the number of shipments is minimized by creating one or more stock transfers from the stock location where the items are available to the primary one. Shipping categories are still honored, by creating different shipments. Stock transfers can also be created outside of the order scope, in such case they have no relationships with shipments and line items.
