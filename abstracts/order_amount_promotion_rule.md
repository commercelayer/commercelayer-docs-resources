Commerce Layer provides a promotional engine built on top of two main resources: [promotions](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/promotions) and [promotion rules](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/promotion_rules). Order amount promotions rules are used to trigger the associated promotion only when the amount of an order is over the specified one. Any other promotions already applied to the order are considered in the comparison.
