Customers must contain an email address and, optionally, a password. Registered customers can get an access token through the Password Flow to manage their data. Customer status can be one of "prospect," (with no orders) "acquired," (with one order), or "repeat" (with two or more orders). Customers can be associated with groups to get access to the related private markets ([learn more](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/customer_groups)).
