Orders get created in a "draft" status and become "pending" when they have a customer and some line items. Draft orders act as shopping carts. Pending orders can be recovered when abandoned. When an order is placed, it can either get "approved" or "cancelled". An approved order becomes "fulfilled" when paid and shipped. Canceling an order automatically voids its payment source's authorization.
