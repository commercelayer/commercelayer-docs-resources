Commerce Layer provides a promotional engine built on top of two main resources: [promotions](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/promotions) and [promotion rules](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/promotion_rules). Percentage discount promotions are defined by market and — when triggered — are responsible for adding a specific percentage discount to the subtotal amount of the market orders. Within the time window given by their activation and expiration dates, percentage discount promotions that have not reached their total usage limit are considered active. If no promotion rule is associated with an active percentage discount promotion, the related discount is applied to all the orders of the market in scope. Otherwise, if one or more promotion rules are defined, the promotion is triggered only when it matches all of them. If a percentage discount promotion is associated with an [SKU list](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/sku_lists), the related discount is calculated on the SKUs belonging to that list only.
