Commerce Layer provides a promotional engine built on top of two main resources: [promotions](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/promotions) and [promotion rules](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/promotion_rules). SKU list promotions rules are used to trigger the associated promotion only if an order contains any (default) or all (set the `all_skus` attribute to `true`) of the SKUs within the specified list. Optionally, is possible to specify a `min_quantity`, which will overwrite previous rules and will be honoured by checking the order's line_items quantities and the matching SKU list item (this rule does not applies to [bundles](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/bundles)).
