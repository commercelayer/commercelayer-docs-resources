# Braintree gateways

Configuring a Braintree payment gateway for a market lets you safely process payments through [Braintree](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs). The Braintree gateway is compliant with the PSD2 European regulation so that you can implement a payment flow that supports SCA and 3DS2 by using the Braintree official JS SDK and libraries.

To create a Braintree gateway choose a meaningful name that helps you identify it within your organization and gather all the [credentials](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/articles/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials) requested (like merchant and merchant account IDs, public and private keys, etc. â€” contact [Braintree's support](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/help) if you are not sure about the requested data).
