# Coupon codes promotion rules

Commerce Layer provides a promotional engine built on top of two main resources: [promotions](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/promotions) and [promotion rules](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/promotion\_rules). Coupon code promotions rules are used to link a promotion to a specific [coupon](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/coupons) so that the promotion is triggered only based on the coupon code.
