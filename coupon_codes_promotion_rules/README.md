# Coupon codes promotion rules

Commerce Layer provides a promotional engine built on top of two main resources: [promotions](../promotions/) and [promotion rules](../promotion\_rules/).

Coupon code promotions rules are used to link a promotion to a specific [coupon](../coupons/) so that the promotion is triggered only based on the coupon code.
