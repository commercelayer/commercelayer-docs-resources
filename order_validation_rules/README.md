# Order validation rules

Order validation rules represent all of the validation rules that apply to the orders associated with a specific market (i.e. [billing info validation rule](../billing\_info\_validation\_rules/)).

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an **immutable API**, meaning that create, update, and delete operations are not allowed on this endpoint. You can only fetch a list of order validation rules or a specific single one.
{% endhint %}
