# Checkout.com gateways

Configuring a Checkout.com payment gateway for a market lets you safely process payments through [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com/docs). The Checkout.com gateway is compliant with the PSD2 European regulation so that you can implement a payment flow that supports SCA and 3DS2 by using the Checkout.com's official JS SDK and libraries.

To create a Checkout.com gateway choose a meaningful name that helps you identify it within your organization and gather all the [credentials](https://api-reference.checkout.com/#section/Authentication) requested (like private and public keys, etc. â€” contact [Checkout.com's support](https://www.checkout.com/contact-us) if you are not sure about the requested data).
