# Stripe gateways

Configuring a Stripe payment gateway for a market lets you safely process payments through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs). The Stripe gateway is compliant with the PSD2 European regulation so that you can implement a payment flow that supports SCA and 3DS2 by using the Stripe's official JS SDK and libraries.

To create a Stripe gateway choose a meaningful name that helps you identify it within your organization and gather all the credentials requested (like [secret and publishable keys](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#obtain-api-keys), etc. â€” contact [Stripe's support](https://support.stripe.com) if you are not sure about the requested data).
