# Parcels

[Shipments](../shipments/) can be split into two or more parcels, that get tracked by the [shipping carrier](../carrier\_accounts/). For cross-border shipments, you can fill in a customs form. The related documentation is automatically generated, updated, and attached to the parcel that will be delivered in a [package](../packages/) to the assigned customer's shipping address.
