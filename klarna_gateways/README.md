# Klarna gateways

Configuring a Klarna payment gateway for a market lets you safely process payments through [Klarna](https://docs.klarna.com). The Klarna gateway is compliant with the PSD2 European regulation so that you can implement a payment flow that supports SCA and 3DS2 by using the Klarna's official JS SDK and libraries.

To create a Klarna gateway choose a meaningful name that helps you identify it within your organization and gather all the [credentials](https://www.klarna.com/us/business/merchant-support/where-do-i-find-and-generate-klarna-api-credentials/) requested (like country code, API key and secret, etc. â€” contact [Klarna's support](https://www.klarna.com/us/business/merchant-support/) if you are not sure about the requested data).
