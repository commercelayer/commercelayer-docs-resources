# Tax calculators

By connecting a tax calculator to a market, all the market orders get automatic tax calculation.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an **immutable API**, meaning that create, update, and delete operations are not allowed on this endpoint. You can only fetch a list of tax calculators or a specific single one.
{% endhint %}
